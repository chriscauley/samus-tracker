* summary
** speed booster
   35.23 (timer.py tourian)
   35.9 (timer.py left hand speed)
   twice running (timer landing)
   31.3 terminator uphill
   35.26 terminator downhill
   x velocity seems slightly (10%) slower uphill (seems about right in maptroid)
* times
** running - speed booster doubles speed
   top speed w/o speed booster = 450ms (27*16.666ms frames of video)
   top speed w/speed booster = 216ms (13*16.666ms frames of video)
* timer.py
** tourian
  8 blocks = pole to pole
  running.mkv => 450ms or 17.66 blocks per second
  walking.mkv => 782ms or 10.23 blocks per second
  speedbooster is double running (from _speedbooster.py)
  running is 1.73x walking
** landing
   measured from start of right edge of ship to left door
   running 4392ms
   walking 7857ms
   speedbooster 2192ms
   conclusion: speedbooster is 2x running
   running is 1.78x faster than
** landing  left speed
   3843 to get from first rightside downslop to left door
   left door is 2 block thick
   right slope is 4 block from edge (varified in maptroid)
   room is 9*16=144 blocks
   138/3843ms 35.9 blocks per second
** terminator
   17 blocks between mushrooms
   speedbooster 543 per mushroom or 31.3 bps
   running 1109 per mushroom or 15.3 bps
   downhill speed 482 per musrhoom or 35.26 bps
* speedbooster.py
  numbers were recorded in frames, but reported in s (using 60 fps)
  speed is b/s (blocks per second)
  acceleration is b/s/s (blocks per second per second)
** walking
   samus gets to top speed in 0.19s w/constant acceleration
   0-10b/s means 53.6b/s/s
** running + speed booster
   samus gets to 13b/s in 0.19s w/constant acceleration
   acceleration is 68.4 b/s/s
   acceleration slows but then is constant until top speed
   using speedbooster curves it's x0=0.2 y0=13 x1=1.8 y1=36
   acceleration is (36-13)/(1.8-0.2) or 14.5b/s/s
** 3 odd curves (shortspark)
   one curve (slowest of all) is shortspark without holding run at end
   slowest curve has a constant speed slower than normal run
   two curves are shortspark with holding run at end
   amazingly, speed never stablizes
* record.py
  running at full speed (no booster), samus moves between columns in 27 frames
  columns are 8 blocks
  samus runs at 17.66 blocks per second
  27 / 8 * 17.66 = 59 frames per second
  We'll assume 60 (internet says snes should be 60)
